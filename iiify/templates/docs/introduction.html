    For those unfamiliar with the IIIF specification, this
    introduction describes the importance and rich applications of
    <a href="https://iiif.io">IIIF</a> and the Internet Archive's IIIF
    Service.

  <h2><a name="intro-iiif">What is IIIF?</a></h2>
  <p>
    <a href="https://iiif.io">IIIF</a> (the "International Image
    Interoperability Framework") is a collection of web standards for
    manipulating and serving image resources (Image API), as well as
    structuring collections of these images (Presentation API).
  </p>

  <h3>Image API</h3>
  <p>
    The <a href="http://iiif.io/api/image/2.0/">Image API</a> is an
    interface capable of producing and serving arbitrary tiles of
    arbitrary regions of an image (like Google Maps). The properties
    of these image tiles are specified within a URL, allowing
    permenant citation and retrieval at a later time
    (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence">idempotence</a>).
    The Image API supports and powers other computer applications
    (like <a href="https://openseadragon.github.io/">zoomable image
    viewers</a>
    and <a href="http://universalviewer.azurewebsites.net/">book
    readers</a>).
  </p>

  <h3>Presentation API</h3>
  <p>
    The <a href="http://iiif.io/api/presentation/2.0/">Presentation
    API</a> allows institutions to publish and consume metadata about
    collections and sequences of image resources, called Manifests.  A
    Manifest may be composed of resources from any number of different
    institutions serving their images in IIIF format.
  </p>

    goals <a href="http://universalviewer.azurewebsites.net/">here</a>.
  </p>
  
  <h2><a name="intro-importance">Importance</a></h2>
  <p>
    At its essence, the goal of IIIF is interoperability: to make an
    institution's image resources available and accessible to web
    applications and clients running on other domains.
  </p>

  <p>
    The <a href="{{ request.url_root }}">Internet Archive IIIF API
    v1</a>
    (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Alpha">alpha</a>)
    is
    a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">RESTful</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_service">web
    service</a> which implements IIIF (Image API &amp; Presentation
    API) and provides a mechanism for accessing all of the Archive's
    images and books in IIIF format. Every image item in the Archive
    now has has a corresponding info.json and every book a
    manifest.json. This means, you can seamlessly view any Archive.org
    image or book in any interface compatible with IIIF (such as
    OpenSeadragon, Mirador, and the Universal Viewer) and also enjoy
    the enhancements they provide (annotation, side-by-size viewing,
    and loading images from different institutions into the same
    space).
  </p>

  <p>
    The service also provides a mechanism for producing permanantly
    citeable image tiles of any arbitrary region of any image or book
    found in the Internet Archive.
  </p>

  <h2>Deploying a IIIF Service</h2>
  <p>
    The Internet Archive IIIF API v1 (alpha) is built using
    Python3.4 <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Flask">Flask</a>
    and the <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/iiif2">iiif2</a>
    libraries. The source code
    for <a href="iiif.archive.org">iiif.archive.org</a> is publicly
    available <a href="https://github.com/mekarpeles/iiif.archive.org">here</a>,
    as is the source of the iiif2 image processing
    library <a href="https://github.com/mekarpeles/iiif2">here</a>. For
    questions on implementing a service,
    contact <a href="mailto:support@archive.org">support@archive.org</a>.
